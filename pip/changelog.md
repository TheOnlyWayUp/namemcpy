# v1.1.1 11-18-2020ðŸ¥³

Smaller update just got rid of a scraped function that I accidently left in the code.





# v1.1.0 11-18-2020ðŸ¥³

1. Added it so when you call a function it will return a value instead of print some useless stuff (if you still want this feature just do a if statment if true or false print(stuff)

2. Added 2 new function uuidToUsername() and usernameToUuid() pretty self explanatory.

3. Fixed some typos and the printFriendListUsernameOutputUuid() As it would outputing name, which was fixed.

Pretty much it
